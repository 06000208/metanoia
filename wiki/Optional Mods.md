This page is intended to list mods not included within the pack itself to give end users and server hosts more control over their games.

Note that:

- Mods already included in the pack or server files are not listed here
- I have marked mods that I'm not confident recommending with an asterisk

## Client Side

- [Optifine](https://optifine.net/)
- [TexFix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/texfix) *
