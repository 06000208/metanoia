This is a set of categories I've designed to assist the creation of the pack in an organized fashion, and it will expand to cover more types of mods as the pack itself grows.

Note that the examples given for each category may not be relevant to the pack.

When a mod could go in multiple categories, whichever category is highest in the list is used. This is because the categories are ordered by how much they effect gameplay, with some exceptions.
